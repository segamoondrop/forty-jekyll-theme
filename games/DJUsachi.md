        <h2 id="design">Design</h2>
        <p>From the start, I knew I had wanted to create a mascot platformer. So the first step was to design the main character. After brainstorming many ideas, I settled on a DJ Bunny and began drawing. Below you can find some of the alternate designs before settling on DJ Usachi herself!</p>
        <h2 id="modeling">Modeling & Animation</h2>
        <p>Once the character was designed, it was time to make it a functional model. I began to quickly research Blender and found out how to animate and implement animations in-game within 3 days.</p>
        <h2 id="coding">Unity & Coding</h2>
        <p>Unity itself was actually quite simple to learn! I had implemented particle effects, learned how to implement shaders and got familiar with Unity engine as a whole. Then came the difficult part for me: coding. I had used a YouTube tutorial for the games main physics and control to get a hang of Visual Code Studio. </p>

        <p>With all of that together, the short game demo was complete! You can check out a short gameplay demo below. Progress on the game has stopped for now, but I would love to pick it up in the future.</p>
