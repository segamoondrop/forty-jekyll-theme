And to the hundreds of thousands of Cambodian brothers, sisters, and loved ones who are not with us today, we pay our respects to all in our villages and in the rice fields and up in the mountains and down in the rivers and those in our cities. We also pay our respects to those who did not survive or thrive in the transition to life in the United States. We hope these stories begin to bring to the surface what has been held under for so long.<br /><br />I had the honor of editing this documentary for the United Cambodian Community on the struggles of survival and immigration the Cambodian community faced during the late 1970's.",
