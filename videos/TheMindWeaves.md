title: The Mind Weaves The Web We Need
description: The Mind Weaves The Webs We Need is an experimental photography exhibition featuring twenty artists from Long Beach City College’s Photography Program. These artists examine and recycle the aesthetic qualities of their previous work rendered through the contemporary application of early photographic processes combined with the new techniques and media. Showing the work at the Ice House–a unique arts complex standing as a landmark of the historical part of Long Beach, enables these artists to weave the impossible and possible of the past and present into their post pandemic life. They continue to create art, regardless of the conditions of the world’s turmoil, spurring them to make even better work for their belief in Peace, Love, and Possibility.
