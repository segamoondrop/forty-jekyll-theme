title: Khmer Voices
description: Credits&#58; Video Editor<br /><br />The United Cambodian Community had the honor of listening to the stories of community leaders. In some cases, stories shared for the first time in the interview, calling up what was hidden deep within to survive the war or genocide or of struggles in a new country. We wanted to show the beauty and richness in these words and the joy - from sharing - and the pain - from remembering - mixed together to nourish Cambodian American culture in Long Beach, CA.<br /><br />This project is dedicated to the community leaders whose bravery compelled them to open up their hearts to this project. And to the hundreds of thousands of Cambodian brothers, sisters, and loved ones who are not with us today, we pay our respects to all in our villages and in the rice fields and up in the mountains and down in the rivers and those in our cities. We also pay our respects to those who did not survive or thrive in the transition to life in the United States. We hope these stories begin to bring to the surface what has been held under for so long.<br /><br />https://ucclb.org/
