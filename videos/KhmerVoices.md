description: <span>Credits&#58; Video Editor<br /><br />The United Cambodian Community had the honor of listening to the stories of community leaders. In some cases, stories shared for the first time in the interview, calling up what was hidden deep within to survive the war or genocide or of struggles in a new country. We wanted to show the beauty and richness in these words and the joy - from sharing - and the pain - from remembering - mixed together to nourish Cambodian American culture in Long Beach, CA.<br /><br /><a target=_blank href='https://ucclb.org/'>https://ucclb.org/</a></span>
